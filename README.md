## Firstly we clean up the data from our [housing.csv](https://github.com/rituraj-navindgikar/ML/blob/main/housing.csv) file 
- We find correlations in data using seaborn's heatmap, these are the features with very high correlations and teach the model same thing again and again
- therefore we combine those into a new feature and delete the old features

## This Python Notebook uses the following Supervised learning Approaches to train and test on [housing.csv](https://github.com/rituraj-navindgikar/ML/blob/main/housing.csv)
- LINEAR REGRESSION 
- RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
- XGBoost
