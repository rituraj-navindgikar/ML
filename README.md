# Firstly we clean up the data from housing.csv file.
- We find correlations in data using seaborn's heatmap, these are the features with very high correlations and teach the model same thing again and again
- therefore we combine those into a new feature and delete the old features

# This Python Notebook uses 2 Supervised learning Approaches to train and test [housing.csv]() file 
- LINEAR REGRESSION 
- RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
- XGBoost
